# Starter Kit Plugin
This is a simple paper plugin which gives a starter kit and display a welcome message to players who join. This supports using minecraft's NBT data format. For example to give a netherite pickaxe with Efficiency 5 you would add "- NETHERITE_PICKAXE[enchantments=sharpness:5,fire_aspect:2]:1" Completely free to use. I don't know for how long i will maintain this but if you have anything to add make sure to make a pull request (;
